# Obsidian Properties

Properties are structured metadata stored as YAML frontmatter at the top of notes. They enable organization, search, filtering, and integration with features like Bases, Templates, and Search.

## Property Format

Properties are YAML between `---` delimiters at the very start of a file:

```yaml
---
title: My Note
tags:
  - journal
  - personal
date: 2024-08-21
---
```

- Each property name must be unique within a note
- Names are separated from values by a colon followed by a space
- Order of properties doesn't matter

## Property Types

Once a type is assigned to a property name, all notes in the vault share that type.

### Text

Single line of text. No markdown rendering. Hashtags do NOT create tags.

Internal links must be quoted:

```yaml
title: A New Hope
link: '[Episode IV](Episode%20IV)'
url: https://www.example.com
```

### List

Multiple values, each on its own line with `- `:

```yaml
cast:
  - Mark Hamill
  - Harrison Ford
  - Carrie Fisher
links:
  - '[Link](Link)'
  - '[Link2](Link2)'
```

Internal links in lists must also be quoted.

### Number

Literal integers or decimals only — no expressions or operators:

```yaml
year: 1977
pie: 3.14
```

### Checkbox

Boolean `true` or `false`. Renders as a checkbox in Live Preview:

```yaml
favorite: true
reply: false
```

### Date

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

```yaml
date: 2024-08-21
```

With the Daily Notes plugin enabled, date properties function as internal links to daily notes.

### Date & Time

Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`

```yaml
time: 2024-08-21T10:30:00
```

### Tags

Special type used exclusively by the `tags` property. Cannot be assigned to other property names. Formatted as a list:

```yaml
tags:
  - journal
  - personal
  - draft
```

## Default Properties

| Property     | Type | Description                                              |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tags`       | List | Note tags (also recognized inline with `#tag`)           |
| `aliases`    | List | Alternative names for the note (used in link resolution) |
| `cssclasses` | List | Apply CSS snippets to style individual notes             |

### Obsidian Publish Properties

| Property          | Description                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `publish`         | Whether to publish the note |
| `permalink`       | Custom URL path             |
| `description`     | Page description            |
| `image` / `cover` | Page image                  |

### Deprecated Properties (removed in Obsidian 1.9)

Use the modern equivalents instead:

- `tag` → use `tags`
- `alias` → use `aliases`
- `cssclass` → use `cssclasses`

## JSON Format

Properties can also be defined as JSON (will be converted to YAML on save):

```yaml
---
{ 'tags': ['journal'], 'publish': false }
---
```

## Best Practices

### When Modifying Properties

- **Always use `update_frontmatter`** — never manually edit YAML via `write_file`
- Use canonical names: `tags` not `tag`, `aliases` not `alias`, `cssclasses` not `cssclass`
- Quote internal links: `"[Note Name](Note%20Name)"` in both text and list properties
- Use proper date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` for datetimes
- Numbers must be literals — no expressions like `1+1`

### When Writing File Content

- Never place content above or inside the frontmatter block
- "Top of the note" means after the closing `---`, not the first line of the file
- Preserve existing frontmatter exactly when using `write_file`

### Property Design Patterns

- Use `tags` for broad categorization (searchable, filterable in Bases)
- Use custom properties for structured data (status, priority, due dates)
- Use `aliases` so notes can be found by alternative names
- Use `cssclasses` to visually distinguish note types (e.g., `dashboard`, `daily-note`)
- Keep property names consistent across your vault — Obsidian enforces type consistency per name

### Integration with Bases

Properties are the foundation of Bases views. Note properties are accessed as `note.property_name` or just `property_name` in Base filters and formulas. Design your property schema with Bases queries in mind.
